kobe *  checking running R code from vignettes ... [15s/15s] ERROR
Errors in running code in vignettes:

  ...
Error : Mapping a variable to y and also using stat="bin".
  With stat="bin", it will attempt to set the y value to the count of cases in each group.
  This can result in unexpected behavior and will not be allowed in a future version of ggplot2.
  If you want y to represent counts of cases, use stat="bin" and don't map a variable to y.
  If you want y to represent values in the data, use stat="identity".
  See ?geom_bar for examples. (Defunct; last used in version 0.9.2)

  When sourcing 'kobe.R':
Error: argument is of length zero
