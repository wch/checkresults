Adding so many packages to the search path is excessive and importing
selectively is preferable.

Packages in Depends field not imported from:
  ‘ggplot2’ ‘plyr’ ‘psych’ ‘reshape’
  These packages need to be imported from (in the NAMESPACE file)
  for when this namespace is loaded but not attached.
Unexported object imported by a ':::' call: ‘ggplot2:::.zeroGrob’
  See the note in ?`:::` about the use of this operator.
There are ::: calls to the package's namespace in its code. A package
  almost never needs to use ::: for its own objects:
  ‘align.plots’
