'library' or 'require' call to 'geometry' which was already attached by Depends.
  Please remove these calls from your code.
Packages in Depends field not imported from:
  'LeafAngle' 'devtools' 'geometry' 'rgl'
  These packages need to be imported from (in the NAMESPACE file)
  for when this namespace is loaded but not attached.
Unexported object imported by a ':::' call: 'rgl:::GramSchmidt'
  See the note in ?`:::` about the use of this operator.
There are ::: calls to the package's namespace in its code. A package
  almost never needs to use ::: for its own objects:
  'plot3dcylinder'
See the information on DESCRIPTION files in the chapter 'Creating R
packages' of the 'Writing R Extensions' manual.
